## Installation and Usage
* Download the latest release from https://github.com/baffler/Transparent-Twitch-Chat-Overlay/releases

* "Windows protected your PC" message may appear which is the Windows Defender Smart Screen. You'll need to click "More info" and then "Run anyway". You'll only have to do this the first time you launch it.
